## About The Project

Swurf Savings is a web application that allows users to track their progress toward different savings goals with three tiers of importance based on what they prioritize.  The user has the ability to add/store their driving shifts which will impact the progress bars for each goal, calculated using its selected priority.  Using average shift income, which changes every time the user uploads a shift, the app provides accurate updates to the number of shifts required to reach a savings goal.

### Main Logic

<img src="images/logic.png" width=500px alt="logic"></img>

e.g. 
John has 3 savingGoals
  - Priority 1: A new iPhone 11 ($699)
  - Priority 2: A new Bike ($300)
  - Priority 3: A new jacket for his dad ($100)

He finished a new shift from 6pm -9pm. He got 100 totally, and he posted it on Swurf. He needs 50% of the income ($50) for basic living, and within the remaining $50:
  - 50% ($25) is for his priority 1 savingGoal(new iPhone 11)
  - 30% ($15) is for his priority 2 savingGoal(new bike)
  - 20% ($10) is for his priority 3 savingGoal(new jacket)

Now the price_remaining for each savingGoal changed:
  - Priority 1: A new iPhone 11 ($699 - $25 = $674)
  - Priority 2: A new Bike ($300 - $15 = $285)
  - Priority 3: A new jacket for his dad ($100 - $10 = $90) 

We use averageShiftIncome = totalIncome / totalShiftWorked to calculate the averageShiftIncome, and use shiftRemaining = price_remaining / (averageShiftIncome * 50% * priorityï¼‰to calculate the shiftRemaining for certain savingGoal.

### Data Structure

For each user, he/she has the following properties:
- username
- email
- password
- time-created (auto-created)

- shifts (Array) 
  > Each shift in shifts array has the following properties:
  - id
  - income
  - start_time
  - end_time
  - time_created (auto-created)
  - isDeleted (default: false. The user can delete the shift after he posted it. This record will still stay is the shifts array, but it will not be used for calculation.)
  
- savingGoals (Array) 
  > Each savingGoal in savingGoals array has the following properties:
  - id
  - title
  - price 
  - price_remaining (will decrease every time when the user post a new shift.)
  - priority (1/2/3)
  - time_created (auto-created)
  - isDeleted (default: false. The user can delete the savingGoal after he posted it. This record will still stay in the savingGoals array, but it will not be used for calculation.)
  - isAchieved (default: false. When the price_remaining of certain savingGoal <= 0, the isAchieved value will change to true.   This record will still stay is the savingGoals array, but it will not be used for the future calculation. )

### Usage
1. Post new saving goals:
*e.g.: I want to buy a $55 new jacket for my dad with medium priority.*

<br />

2. Post new shifts:
*e.g.: I fished a Uber shift from 2:00 pm to 6:00 pm today. .*

<br />

3. The system will automatically updated the progress bar, so the user will know how close they are to their saving goals.

<br />

### Stretch Goals
* Use Plaid API for bank account linking.
* Use Uber driver and other API to submit new shift automatically.
* Use different calculation for rush hour & non rush hour.

### Build With
* Node.js
* Express.js
* Mongo DB Atlas
<br />
